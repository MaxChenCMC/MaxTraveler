# Task Review

## Changes Made

- **`home.html`**: 
  - Updated the `defaultGroups` array in the JavaScript section.
  - Changed the default group from `{ name: '美食', icon: '🍔', ... }` to `{ name: '餐廳', icon: '🍴', ... }`.
- **Provided Instructions**: Gave the user a JavaScript snippet to run in the browser console to update their existing data stored in `localStorage`, ensuring the icon change is reflected immediately for them without data loss.
