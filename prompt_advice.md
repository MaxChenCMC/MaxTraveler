# Prompt Advice

- **Clear Action**: The request was a direct command to perform a data-modification-like action ("I want to change the icon for 'Restaurant' to 'fork'"), which is clear and actionable.
- **Implicit vs. Explicit**: The request implies a change to the application's data. It's helpful to clarify if the change should be a permanent change in the code (for default data) or a one-time change for the user's current data. In this case, I addressed both.
- **Future Consideration**: For similar data-editing tasks, providing a simple UI for such customizations (like an icon picker for groups) within the app itself could be a great future feature.
