- **Detailed Bug Reports are Gold**: Providing the exact HTML snippet of the problematic element was the key to solving this. It allowed me to see the rendered output and understand that my previous assumptions were wrong. This is an excellent practice for reporting UI bugs.
- **Persistence is Key**: Your persistence in reporting that the bug was not fixed was crucial. It forced me to re-evaluate my solution and find the true root cause of the layout issue.
- **Visuals + Code = Clarity**: Combining a screenshot with the corresponding HTML snippet is the most effective way to communicate a front-end bug.
